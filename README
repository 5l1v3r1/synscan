** NOTE **
This is the first official Synscan5 release!, and may not function correctly.

Licensed under the GPL version 2. If you modify this app for your own
needs, we would appreciate a copy of the changes being emailed to us!

Synscan works using 2 programs..
The "synscan" tool will send SYN packets.
And a second program, sslog will listen for the resulting SYN/ACK
packets to determine if ports are open.
